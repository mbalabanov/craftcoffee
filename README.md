# CF11 Backend Team 6
Final project for the backend/fullstack at CodeFactory (CF11). The objective of this project is to develop an online store where customers can browse the product catalog and select the desired products. The selected items will be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout the items from the shopping cart will be displayed and the customer can pay the order. An email notification will be sent to the customer when the order is completed.
